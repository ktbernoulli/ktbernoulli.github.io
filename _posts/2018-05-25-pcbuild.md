Some of you have been asking very very <strike>relentlessly</strike> nicely, so:
# kateta : Current Machine Learning Server Build

CPU : AMD Ryzen 7 Threadripper 1900x <br>
GPU : MSI GeForce GTX 1080 8GB <br>
Motherboard : Gigabyte - X399 AORUS Gaming 7 ATX TR4 Motherboard <br>
RAM : I forget, but it's at 2x4GB + 2x8GB = 24GB DDR4 goodness. <br>
Memory : Samsung 960 EVO 250GB SSD + WTD Blue 2TB. <br>
Case : Thermaltake - Suppressor F31 <br>
Cooler : Corsair - H115i 104.7 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler <br>
Power : Corsair - RMx (2018) 750W 80+ Gold <br>

All components grabbed at Fry's, price matched with Amazon, & came with an extra $50 for GPU installation, <br>
because I know better than to try to do that myself, after a $120 installation total fee for the original parts. <p>

She kicks up all four+ fans whenever I am running that drastic loan dataset that everyone hate. <p>
