Some of you have been asking very very <strike>relentlessly</strike> nicely, so:
# kateta : Current Machine Learning Server Build

CPU : AMD Ryzen 7 Threadripper 1900x
GPU : MSI GeForce GTX 1080 8GB
Motherboard : Gigabyte - X399 AORUS Gaming 7 ATX TR4 Motherboard
RAM : I forget, but it's at 2x4GB + 2x8GB = 24GB.
Memory : Samsung 960 EVO 250GB SSD + WTD Blue 2TB.
Case : Thermaltake - Suppressor F31
Cooler : Corsair - H115i 104.7 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler
Power : Corsair - RMx (2018) 750W 80+ Gold

All components grabbed at Fry's, price matched with Amazon, & came with an extra $50 for GPU installation,
because I know better than to try to do that myself.

She kicks up all four+ fans whenever I am running that drastic loan dataset that everyone hate.
