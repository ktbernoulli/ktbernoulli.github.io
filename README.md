Hello there, my name is Kate & I am pretty repetitive because I have a degree in pattern recognition, aka math.
### I'm pretty sure it's a crime that I do not have a personal space on GitHub.
# So here it is.

This page will contain posts to direct the students of theDevMasters in creating their own GitHub page <br>
as well as guidelines for other aspects, such as uploading their resume, projects, etc. <p>

This also sparked me to create some more semi-professional accounts for you to follow me on, <br>
such as Twitter, Facebook, & Medium. If you have any questions, please direct your questions to my email.
