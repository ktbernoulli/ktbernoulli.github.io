<p>Somehow you decided to click on my profile picture instead of my
<a href="https://ktbernoulli.github.io/resume">resume</a> so here's a little about me.</p>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>My favorite color is lavender; it is close to morning sunrise purple.</li>
	<li>My first coding language was HTML, designing my Myspace page. CSS scares me slightly.</li>
	<li>The first time I was exposed to statistics was when my high school
	AP Statistics teacher came to my trigonometry class <b>& did a legitimate
	business presentation</b> <b><i>in front of 15-17 year olds</b></i> about the fact that
	they can take any path they want for mathematical learning, but they
	will come back to learn statistics. He was damn right. As usual.</li>
	<li>I originally wanted to be an accountant. That is data, per say,
	but there is a level of hell that burns a little too hot & for me, it's accounting.</li>
	<li>I have been described with words such as intelligent, wise, mature, friendly,
	resourceful, mindful, understanding, positive, level-headed, etc. etc.
	But I'm pretty sure it's only because I think before I speak.</li>
	<li>If anything, I know I should always be in the student mindset,
	because someone out there will always know more than you in any subject,
	it would be foolish to consider myself a sole expert in any subject.</li>
	<li>& yes, I do really like broccoli tempura.</li>
</ul>

Here is a random music video that I am currently feeling,
