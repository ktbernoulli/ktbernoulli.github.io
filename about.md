<p>Somehow you decided to click on my profile picture instead of my
<a href="https://ktbernoulli.github.io/resume">resume</a> so here's a little about me.</p>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>My favorite color is lavender; it is close to morning sunrise purple.</li>
	<li>My first coding language was HTML, CSS scares me slightly.</li>
	<li>The first time I was exposed to statistics was when my high school
	AP Statistics teacher came to my trigonometry class <b>& did a legitimate
	business presentation</b> in front of 15-17 year olds about the fact that
	they can take any path they want for mathematical learning, but they
	will come back to learn statistics. He was damn right. As usual.</li>
	<li>I originally wanted to be an accountant. That is data, per say,
	but there is a level of hell that burns a little too hot for me & it's accounting.</li>
	<li>Scrum and Kanban</li>
	<li>TDD e Continuous Integration</li>
</ul>
