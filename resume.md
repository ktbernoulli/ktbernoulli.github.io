<p>Unfortunately, if you want a true copy of my resume, you should definitely email me.
Here is a short list of my specific programming languages & notable mathematical concepts that I have more than intermediate level knowledge, as well as experience with.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>HTML, since 2007.</li>
	<li><b>R,</b> since 2013.</li>
	<li>MacroVBA, since 2014.</li>
	<li>SPSS, since 2014.</li>
	<li><b>Python,</b> since 2016.</li>
</ul>

Other languages such as C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, SQL, etc. I have little experience with.

<h2>Mathematical</h2>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Calculus I, II, III : Multivariate Calculus.</li>
	<li>Differential Equations</li>
	<li>Linear Algebra</li>
	<li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
	<li>Advanced Strategies of Proofs</li>
	<li>Probability Theory</li>
	<li>Applied Statistics</li>
	<li>Mathematical Statistics</li>
	<li>Data Statistical Analysis</li>
	<li><b>Stochastic Processes</b></li>
	<li>Statistical Learning</li>
	<li>Time Series Analysis</li>
	<li>Mathematical Model Building</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

I unfortunately am not comfortable to call myself a Bayesian expert, but Markov is no sweat.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Coming soon!</li>
</ul>

Being a data scientist means I have projects, just not those that are public-friendly.
